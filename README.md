# Cancer Rate Regression Modeling
#### STAT 301-3 Final Project

Utilized NIH and Census data to predict the mean per capita (100,000) cancer mortality rate in each US county. From this data, correlations were identified between the target variable and several predictor variables like poverty rates, proportion of education levels, unemployment levels, public and private coverage rates, and income. Several predictive and machine learning regression models were utilized and tuned over three attempts to enhance their performance. The models included support vector machine (radial basis function), support vector machine (polynomial), random forest, single Layer Neural Network (multilayer perceptron), MARS model, simple linear regression, nearest neighbors, and boosted tree. From this, the most accurate model was fitted to the testing dataset to evaluate its performance.
